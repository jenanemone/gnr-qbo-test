Playing with Intuit API with the goal of integrating HTML forms for client

#### Client requests a major update to the basic functionality of their customer-facing site to include:
* Ability to input their own info (name, contact numbers, emails, address, etc)
* Ability to choose which type of product they'll be buying (drop-down menu)
* Integration into at least one mapping API in order to estimate shipping charges
* Integration into client's QuickBooks Online for the express purpose of creating an invoice directly from the webpage.

#### Actions continue to ripple for client:
* QBO is preferred vendor for tax tables
* QBO can be triggered to automatically send customers their invoices once been created within QBO after triggering API
* QBO will then include online payment options within email/hosted on their own servers
